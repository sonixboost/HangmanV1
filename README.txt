This is my first attempt at a python script game, created out of boredom and the eagerness to learn python more.

There are very a few very simple functions, namely
1) hangman(): Basically prints out lives
2) check(): Check for the right letter(s)
3) guess(): Takes in the input of player and ensure it is a valid guess before passing to check()
4) list_duplicates_of(): To compliment to check() function, mainly to check multiple of the same letters and
                         allowing check() to replace the blanks correctly.

Plans:
V1 is a very basic proof of concept for me, V2 will most likely still be a script, but with better printing
output (actual hangman picture?).
